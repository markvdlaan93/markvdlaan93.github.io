## The author

**Personal details:** Mark van der Laan, 26 years old and from Den Bosch, the Netherlands.

**Professional live:** Since December 2018, I work as a DevOps engineer in the Netherlands. My work primarily consists of developing API's, managing NoSQL databases with terabytes of data and build the necessary infrastructure.

Before December 2018, I have been both a part-time (during college) and full-time Backend Web Developer, primarily working in PHP (Symfony and CakePHP). 

**Education:** I have a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Information Science from the Utrecht University and a Master of Science (MSc) in Data Science from the Tilburg University. In my bachelor thesis, I focused on the applicability of blockchain in voting processes (like general elections). For my master thesis, I did research into how to apply machine learning to voice recognition.
