## What's this about?

This blog presents a serie of articles which explains everything you need to know about developing your own boards. Currently, the blog posts are primarily focused on AVR microcontrollers (ATMega) which I use extensively.

## Motivation

Since a while I have been keen to learn more about firmware and hardware development. My professional working life is primarily focused on high-level business applications where there is a virtually unlimited amount of RAM and disk space. The trade-offs in such environment are first and foremost based on costs. 

Although cost considerations are also important in embedded development, there are also more interesting problems like power consumption, real-time response and creating interfaces with peripherals.
