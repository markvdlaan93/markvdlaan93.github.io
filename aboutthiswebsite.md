## What's this about?

This blog presents a serie of articles which explains everything you need to know about developing your own boards. Currently, the blog posts are primarily focused on AVR microcontrollers (ATMega) which I use extensively.

## Motivation

Since a while I have been keen to learn more about firmware and hardware development. My professional working life is primarily focused on high-level business applications where there is a virtually unlimited amount of RAM and disk space. The trade-offs in such environment are first and foremost based on costs. 

Although cost considerations are also important in embedded development, there are also more interesting problems like power consumption, real-time response and creating interfaces with peripherals.

## The author

**Personal details:** Mark van der Laan, 26 years old and from Den Bosch, the Netherlands.

**Professional live:** Since December 2018, I work as a DevOps engineer in the Netherlands. My work primarily consists of developing API's, managing NoSQL databases with terabytes of data and build the necessary infrastructure. 

Technologies that I'm currently using professionaly: *Amazon Web Services (AWS), Java Spring Boot, Cassandra, Terraform, Ansible, Docker and Kubernetes*. 

Before December 2018, I have been both a part-time (during college) and full-time Backend Web Developer, primarily working in PHP (Symfony and CakePHP). 

**Education:** I have a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Information Science from the Utrecht University and a Master of Science (MSc) in Data Science from the Tilburg University. In my bachelor thesis, I focused on the applicability of blockchain in voting processes (like general elections). For my master thesis, I did research into how to apply machine learning to voice recognition.
