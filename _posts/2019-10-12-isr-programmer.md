## Overview

Okay cool, you now bought all the necessities to start programming your AVR MCU (MicroController Unit) but how do you actually get code on the chip itself? How do you supply power to the MCU? In this post, I will discuss all the necessary steps that you need to 

## Prerequisites
* **Breadboard**
* **Arduino Uno:** it doesn't really matter if you get a new real one or a fake Chinese copy.
* **Jumper cables**
* **AVR ATMega MCU:** it doesn't matter which one you get. In this post, I will use an ATMega328P (same one that is used in the Arduino itself).
* **Led:** we need to actually do something to see whether the firmware is succesfully uploaded to the chip. Therefore, we will start with turning on a Light Emitted Diode (LED).
* **220Î© resistor:** Avoid that the LED receives too much current.
