## Overview

In this article, I give a quick overview of all the basic electronic components that you will use during developing electronic circuits.

## Components

### Breadboard

A breadboard is a component which you can use to components. Breadboards come in different sizes and their names stems from the fact that back in the days you would put electronic components inside a real breadboard.

Most common are breadboards with strips of five holes in which you plugin jumper cables or electronic components. Most breadboards also have two vertical strips at both sides which you can use for powering the breadboard. Sometimes they have blue and red colors attached to it which indicates for which polarity you should use it (plus or minus). Although these strips are used for power, from a hardware point-of-view there is nothing special about them.
